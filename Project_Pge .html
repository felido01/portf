    <h2>Results and Insights</h2>
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>The attrition percentage compared to that of no attrition is fortunately very low. Analysis focuses primarily on the factors that contribute to attrition. This approach helps in identifying the most impactful aspects affecting employee turnover and guiding strategic HR interventions.</p>
    <p>The key findings from this dashboard are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Which factors have the most significant impact on employee attrition rates:</strong> <br>
            The analysis revealed that factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and tenure at the company are the leading causes of employee attrition. Employees with lower satisfaction scores and shorter tenures were more likely to leave the company. The insights show the importance of focusing on these areas to improve retention rates.
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Correlation between employee satisfaction and retention rates:</strong>
            A strong negative correlation was found between employee satisfaction and attrition. Employees who reported higher job satisfaction were less likely to leave. This insight underscores the importance of enhancing employee satisfaction through improved workplace policies, benefits, and engagement strategies.
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Attrition distribution across departments and job roles:</strong>
            By examining the attrition rates across different departments and job roles, I found that the research and development department has the highest turnover rate and the job Role with the highest attrition is laboratory technician which is also under research and development  department while human resources department has relatively low attrition. The  sales executive role is also struggling with high turnover rate which is under the sales department. This information allows HR to focus retention efforts on the most vulnerable departments and job roles.
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Targeted areas for HR improvement to reduce turnover:</strong>
            The dashboard highlighted key areas for improvement, including leadership training, employee recognition programs, and better work-life balance initiatives. By addressing these areas, HR can implement strategies to reduce employee dissatisfaction and turnover, particularly among high-risk groups such as new hires or employees nearing retirement.
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Impact of compensation and benefits on attrition:</strong>
            The data revealed that employees with competitive salaries and benefits were significantly less likely to leave. This finding reinforces the importance of fair compensation policies and continuous evaluation of employee benefits packages.
        </li>
    </ul>
